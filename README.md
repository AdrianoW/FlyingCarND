# FlyingCarND
My projects submitted to the Flying Car Nanodegree. For all of them, there is a readme on how to execute them. They are part of the Udacity's Flying Car Nanodegree program. 

# The Projects
## 1 - Backyard-Flyer
The first project is a simple way to understand how waypoints work for a drone flying in a simulated environment.

## 2 - Motion-Planning
In this project we calculate the path from 2 points using various methods do to the path planning.

## 3 - Controls-CPP
A drone needs controls to properly mantain its altitude and flight in the planned route. In this project the goal is to program the trust controls that makes the drone fly.

## 4 - Estimation-CPP
Taking the previous project further, this project simulates the uncertainty of sensors and how can estimation be used to control the drone.
